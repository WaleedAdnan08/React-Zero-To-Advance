# My React Project

Welcome to My React Project! This project is designed to be a simple introduction to building web applications with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install all of the project's dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

my-react-project/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── package.json
└── ...

- `node_modules/`: This folder contains all of the project's dependencies, as installed by npm.
- `public/`: This folder contains the project's `index.html` file and any other static assets.
- `src/`: This folder contains the project's source code.
    - `components/`: This folder contains the React components that make up the application.
    - `index.js`: This file is the entry point for the application. It is responsible for rendering the `App` component to the page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
